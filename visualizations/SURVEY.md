# Qualitative Test
These are 30 scenes generalized with our sample-based approach. We carried out a small survey in which we asked six participants to judge the quality of these scenes.
We asked the six participants to judge whether the relations in those scenes were demonstrated by a human or generated by a computer (whereas in fact they were
all computed using our approach). Despite the fact that we do not consider physics checks (e.g., scene stability) or optimize computed scenes to make them more realistic, 63.05% of the
scenes were thought to have been produced by a human.
